## (b)

```{r}

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

install.packages("dslabs")  
library(dslabs)

data("polls_us_election_2016")
y <- 0
for (col in names(polls_us_election_2016)) {
  y <- y + sum(is.na(polls_us_election_2016[[col]]))
}
print(paste("Toplam NA sayisi:", y))


guncelpolls <- polls_us_election_2016 


guncelpolls[sapply(guncelpolls, is.numeric)] <- lapply(guncelpolls[sapply(guncelpolls, is.numeric)], function(x) {
  x[is.na(x)] <- 2003
  return(x)
})


guncelpolls[sapply(guncelpolls, function(x) is.character(x) || is.factor(x))] <- lapply(guncelpolls[sapply(guncelpolls, function(x) is.character(x) || is.factor(x))], function(x) {

  if (is.factor(x)) {
    x <- as.character(x)
  }
  x[is.na(x)] <- "Batuhan"
  return(x)
})

z <- 0
for (col in names(guncelpolls)) {
  z <- z + sum(is.na(guncelpolls[[col]]))
}
print(paste("Toplam NA sayisi:", z))

print(head(guncelpolls, 10))  
```
